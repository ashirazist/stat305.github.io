1. **Competency Topic: Discrete Random Variables** 

   Let $X$ be a random variable with the following distribution with probability function $$f(x) = \begin{cases} \frac{c}{x} & x = 1, 2, 3, 4 \\\\ 0 & o.w. \end{cases} $$ where $c$ is a constant.
   a. Find the value of $c$ that makes $f(x)$ a valid probability function. \vspace{8em}
   b. Find the value of $E(X)$. \vspace{8em}
   c. Find the value of $\sigma^2$ for this random variable. \vspace{6em}

2. **Competency Topic: Continuous Random Variables** 

   A Weibull random variable is a continuous random variable with cumulative density function: $$ F(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & x < 0 \\\\ 1 - e^{-(x/\alpha)^{\beta}} & x \ge 0 \end{cases} $$ for any $\alpha > 0$ and $\beta > 0$.
   a. Find the probability that $X$ is less than 3 (the answer will include in terms of $\alpha$ and $\beta$). \vspace{4cm}
   b. Find the probability density function of $X$ (the answer will include $\alpha$ and $\beta$)
