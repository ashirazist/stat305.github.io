3. **Competency Topic: Joint Distributions**

   Let $X$ be uniform on $(0, 2)$, i.e., $X$ has pdf $$ f_X(x) = \begin{cases} 0.5 & 0 \le x \le 2 \\ 0 & o.w. \end{cases}$$ Also, suppose that $Y$ has a uniform distribution that depends on $X$ so that $$ f_{Y|X}(y|x) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{2x} & -x \le y \le x \\ 0 & o.w. \end{cases} $$
   a. Sketch the pdf of $Y$ given that $X =2$. \vspace{4cm}
   b. Find the joint probability density function of $X$ and $Y$, $f_{XY}(x, y)$

4. **Competency Topic: Functions of Random Variables**

   Suppose that $X$ has an exponential distribution with mean $\alpha = 3$. In other words, $f_X(x) = \frac{1}{3} \exp\left(\frac{x}{3}\right)$ for $x \ge 0$ and is 0 everywhere else. Let $Y$ be a random variable defined by $Y = X^2$.
   a. Find the probability that $Y \le 4$. (hint: you may want the cdf of $X$)\vspace{5cm}
   b. Find the probability density function of $Y$.
