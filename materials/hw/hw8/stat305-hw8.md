1. Chapter 5, Problem 37 (page 331 - ask if the "hint" in part d is confusing)

2. Chapter 5, Problem 33 (page 330 - this is a good example of CQ style problems) 

3. Chapter 5, Problem 35 (page 330 notice that if $y \le x$, then $f(x, y) = 0$)

4. Suppose that $Z_1, Z_2, \ldots, Z_n$ are $n$ independent standard normal random variables. It may be helpful to recall that $E(a Z_i + b) = a E(Z_i) + b$ and that $Var(a Z_i + b) = a^2 Var(Z_i)$ for any constants $a, b$ in addition to knowing that $\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$.
   a. Find the expected value and variance of $X$ where $X = 3 Z_1 + 5$

   b. Find the expected value and variance of $Y$ where $Y = Z_1 - Z_2$

   c. Find the expected value and variance of $U$ where $U = Z_1 - Z_1$

   d. Find the expected value and variance of $W$ where $W = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{i}{n} \left(Z_i + \frac{i}{n}\right)$.
