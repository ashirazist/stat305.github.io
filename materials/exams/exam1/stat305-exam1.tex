\question

In the field of psychology, the Dunningâ€“Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people of low ability overestimate their ability and students with high ability underestimate their ability.
In order to study this phenomenon, a team of psychologists at Iowa State asked students from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences to estimate the score they would receive on a standardized grammar test (as a percentage from 0 to 100).
They recorded the student's sex, age, and major. 
The students were then given the standardized grammar test with 50 questions and the number of correct answers was recorded.

\question \textbf{Twin Cinema}

A professor of theoretical sociology is convinced that horror movies contribute to anxiety.
In order to test his hypothesis, the professor arranged to have to students in his class go to a movie showing on campus for extra credit. 
However, he randomly told half the students to see a movie in one location (location A) showing a scary movie!
The other half of his students, he sent to a second location (location B) showing a romantic comedy.
In order to fund this experiment throught the National Institute of Health, the professor added a nutrition component: in order to examine the effect of diet on anxiety, he gave the students a voucher which could be redeemed for either a high caffeine soda, a tub of popcorn, or a candy snack.
At the end of the movies, he recorded which movie the student had seen, which snack they had chosen, and then gave the student a questionairre that scored the student as having low, medium, or high anxiety.

\question \textbf{From Blown Speakers}

%-- Problem setup code


In car audio speakers, large changes in the intensity of sound produced by the speaker may cause a speaker component known as a cone to vibrate non-uniformly. 
The non-uniform vibrations of the cone cause the cone to add stress to the materials surrounding the cone. 
The damage to the surrounding materials results in the sound produced by the speakers becoming crackly - a state in which the speaker is "blown out".

Audio engineers working on ways to stabilize the cone during large changes in intensity are reviewing data that a 
new "smart" audio system collects and reports information when a blown speaker is detected. 
The following is a list of the \textbf{change in intensity} (as measured in decibels) from the first 35 audio systems that sent a blown speaker report.

\question \textbf{Champions Red Wine}
%-- : R code (Code in Document)


Oenophiles, or connoisseurs of fine wines, have been benefitted by sort of open information sharing we have in the days of online auctions. 
By monitoring the prices for which sought after bottles actually sell for, wine enthusiasts are able to both determine whether or not they are getting a fair price and whether or not they might make a nice profit by selling off a few of the bottles they have in storage.
Before this era of easy and free data though, there was one source of information that stood above all the others: \textit{Le Champions de vin rouge}, a guide to the world of fine wines published in 1997.
While the information contained it in is largely still relevant in general, the price index has become somewhat outdated.

Or has it? 
Is it possible that the prices from the guide in 1997 could help us understand the market today?
A certain statistician decided to do a deep analysis of the relationship between the cost of wine bottles in the 1997 book and the actual prices the same bottles fetched on open auction sites recently. 
The dataset he created consists of the last 500 bottles with publically available auction prices that were also listed in \textit{Le Champions de vin rouge} price index.

Here are some summaries of the dataset with the 1997 Guide Price as $x$ and the Recent Auction Price as $y$.

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{500} x_i = 54348 \hspace{3cm} \sum_{i=1}^{500} x_i^2 = 6164828 \\
